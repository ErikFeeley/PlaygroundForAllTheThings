# Alllrighty then

So it looks like we might have some options here for how we are going to get some original data from firebase. one option is that we can sorta skip all the config stuff on our end and just make the http calls out to firebase, and assuming that AS IT has configured things correctly the users that we authenticate should have at least read access to their role (kiosk vs admin) and what distributor that they are connected to. still need their firebase api key however
